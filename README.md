## General

Our vision with this project is to create an intuitive application that leverages both the power of user intelligence and modern ML techniques to generate datasets and insights to drive efficient city planning.

For example, a road that you frequent is in disrepair. However, the authorities are too slow to pick up on this because most of their working process are still working with surveys and census, heavily impeded by bereaucracy. 

With out product, you would be able to take a photo of the damages. This will feed through a ML Model that extracts information from your photo. This will be used to update a comprehensive historical dataset on the entirety of Frankfurt. Authorities in planning can now use this to more efficiently drive their repair work. 

## Proof of Concept
