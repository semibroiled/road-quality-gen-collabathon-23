## General

Our vision with this project is to create an intuitive application that leverages both the power of user intelligence and modern ML techniques to generate datasets and insights to drive efficient city planning.

For example, a road that you frequent is in disrepair. However, the authorities are too slow to pick up on this because most of their working process are still working with surveys and census, heavily impeded by bereaucracy. 

With out product, you would be able to take a photo of the damages. This will feed through a ML Model that extracts information from your photo. This will be used to update a comprehensive historical dataset on the entirety of Frankfurt. Authorities in planning can now use this to more efficiently drive their repair work. 

## Proof of Concept

## Architecture

## Open Source Technologies being leveraged in this Project

## Working Principles

### Running on a container

The prequisites are, that Docker needs to be installed on local computer and should be running

1) Run `docker-compose up road_quality_app``

2) Run `docker build -t road_quality_app . --no-cache`



### Runnin locally in a Virtual Environment

First, make you virtual environemnt with 

- `python3 m venv .venv`

Install all the required packages to your virutal environment


All packages and relevant frameworks are downloaded in the `.venv` virtual environment directory. 

You can activate this with `source .venv/bin/activate`
